  <h3 class="page-header" align="center">Welcome to the Yamaha Keyboard Festival</h3>
  <p align="center">Youâ€™re invited to be involved in one of the largest keyboard festivals in Australia.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Yamaha Keyboard Festival is a fun, relaxed performance opportunity in which all students can participate. Any age and skill level is welcome - all performers just need to have a desire to have fun with music and will be rewarded with a medal and certificate to acknowledge their participation.</p>
  <p>You can choose to play any style of music as a solo or even in an ensemble with friends! Our youngest performer to date was a 4 year old and our eldest was 90 years young! There is also the chance to be selected to perform at the prestigious Yamaha Keyboard Festival State Gala to be held towards the end of the year.</p>
  <p>In 2016 over 1,500 students participated in Yamaha Keyboard Festivals across Australia.</p>

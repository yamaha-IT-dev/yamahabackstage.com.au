      <p>Historically, timpani makers have used aluminium to make timpani where there was a shortage of copper. They found that aluminium replicates the look, feel and sound of copper as close as possible. Yamaha has decided to make both entry level series of timpani in aluminium to ensure the player receives a true timpani experience at an affordable price. Our new TP6300 and TP7300 series feature a new bowl design that brings out the best that copper has to offer with a solid, well-defined tone. Yamaha has timpani to suit every need, from a school band on tour to a professional orchestra.</p>

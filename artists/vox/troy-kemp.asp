      <p><em>“The full rich tones of the Vox Hand-Wired guitar amps are second to none”</em></p>
      <p>Troy Kemp is one half of Australia’s dynamic country duo McAlister Kemp.</p>
      <p>Since releasing their album All Kinds of Tough last year, the duo McAlister Kemp have gone from strength to strength. A combination of a great debut album full of top notch songs and a strong live act, has positioned them as the break out act in Australian Country Music over the past twelve months.</p>
      <p>The album's title, ‘All Kinds of Tough’, in many ways sums up what McAlister Kemp are all about. Their songs touch on the core issues faced on a daily basis by everyday Australians, while maintaining that knockabout humor that so uniquely defines this nation and its people.</p>
      <p>This first single from the album reached #1 on the National Country Airplay Chart and the Country Music Channel's Top 3. It was followed-up by the lyrically stunning, 'It Don’t Buy You Love', which also peaked in the CMC Top 10 and gained more radio attention for the group.</p>
      <p>The album’s third single, ‘Hell Yeah’, exploded on to the country music airplay and video charts holding at #1 for most of January 2011. It was during this month that the duo picked up the award for Best New Australian Artist at the CMAA Golden Guitar Awards in Tamworth. This was closely followed by being awarded CMC’s Best New Oz Artist in March 2011.</p>
      <p>They opened for Alan Jackson at five “sold out” arena shows around Australia in early 2011, and in June 2011 they represented Australian Country Music in Nashville at the CMA Global Artist Party.</p>

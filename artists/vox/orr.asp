      <h4>Numbers Radio</h4>
      <p>David plays <strong>AC30CC2X</strong></p>
      <p><em>“It’s always a hard question when someone asks “What style of music do you guys play?” Well in my head its raw British infused rock, I’ve always been drawn to a classic tone with a fresh approach. To me the guitar tone IS Numbers Radio. We are a Power trio; I need my voice to be full, unique and to make the most of my third of the sound of Numbers Radio. I use an AC30.”</em></p>
      <p>David Orr is the founding member of NUMBERS RADIO, a hi-energy rock band from Brisbane, Australia.</p>
      <p>The band formed in 2008, and within months they had taken out the national youth radio competition, Triple J Unearthed. From there the band’s first 3 singles, <em>‘Come On’</em>, <em>‘Boring’</em> &amp; <em>‘Automatic’</em> received high rotation on radio nationally, which lead to festival performances at Homebake, Come Together, Sounds Of Spring, plus supports for  Birds Of Tokyo, You Am I, British India, The Bronx and numerous headline tours.</p>
      <p>This vigorous touring schedule has definitely earned the band their live stripes. Night after night they dish up a tight, fierce performance, bringing their relentless rock songs to life on stage. As Fasterlouder put it... <em>“Numbers Radio”</em> demonstrates a <em>“Children Collide”</em>-esque ability to transform their uncomplicated power pop into something edgy and interesting in the live arena.... Numbers Radio represents some of the best elements from the new crop of Australian rock groups&quot;.</p>
      <p>The band’s latest release, a 7 track mini album released Nov 2010 again saw the first single Final Day instantly added to hi-rotation on national youth network Triple J, and edging them even closer to the top of Aussie rock!</p>

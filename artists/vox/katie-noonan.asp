      <h1>Katie Noonan</h1>
      <h4>Katie Noonan and the Captains / Elixir / Katie Noonan’s Blackbird Sextet</h4>
      <p>Katie plays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AC30CC2X</li>
        <li>AC15</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>“The Vox AC30 and Vox AC15 amp are the perfect accompaniment to my projects. Their unique sound and gorgeous valve warmth brings the perfect blend to our music. I also use Yamaha monitors in my studio for getting a really clear, clean sound.”</em></p>
      <p>Katie Noonan's technical mastery and pure voice make her one of Australia's most versatile and beloved vocalists. A mother, singer, producer, songwriter, pianist and business woman, this multi award winning and 6 x platinum selling songstress first received widespread praise as the angel-voiced songstress of indie-pop band George and she has since taken audiences on sublime excursions through jazz, pop and classical music. Her various releases include her folk trio's self titled album 'elixir', the No. 1 selling classical album 'Two of a Kind' with her mother Maggie and her gold-selling top ten album solo album 'Skin'. She has also worked with the country's top orchestra's including her recent fruitful collaboration with Richard Tognetti and the Australian Chamber Orchestra.</p>
      <p>Noonan's affinity with jazz shone through the ARIA award winning album, 'Before Time Could Change Us'. Recorded with revered pianist Paul Grabowsky, it captured the breathtaking beauty and emotion which characterises her work. In Noonan's 2009 ARIA winning release 'Blackbird', she collaborated with an historic ensemble of iconic jazz players including Joe Lovano, Ron Carter, Lewis Nash and John Scofield.</p>
      <p>Katie's 2010 release 'Emperor's Box' was a welcome return to form for Katie. With her band The Captains (Cameron Deyell, Stu Hunter and Declan Kelly) this album saw the songstress sail towards a beloved lush and organic band sound, with her trademark strong and inspired personal stories.</p>
      <p>For this album, Katie co wrote with a host of Anzac luminaries including Tim Finn, Don Walker, Sia Furler, Josh Pyke, Tom Shapcott and her fellow 'Captains' band mates. Co -produced by Katie and Grammy award winning engineer/producer Nick Didia this album was widely critically acclaimed, with Rolling Stone Magazine's 4 star review saying 'it is a joy to hear Noonan return to the more traditional pop of Emperor's Box, albeit with a sumptuous and skewed take on the art form that combines the experimental beauty of Sigur Ros and Radiohead with the dark, dreamy atmospherics of 27' and Kathy McCabe describing it as 'deliciously over-the-top alternative pop'.</p>
      <p>Katie is never content to rest in her comfort zone and in 2011 alone she has collaborated with a wonderfully diverse range of artists, including The Sydney Dance Company for the World Premiere of 'LANDFORMS', Australian composer Elana Kats-Cherin for the World Premiere of 'The Little Green Road to Fairyland' for the Queensland Music Festival and Internationally acclaimed classical guitarist Karin Schaupp in a 20 date sold out Australian tour.</p>

  <p><em>“VOX amplifiers have “that” sound, the sound that frees you up to focus on the music and not on the equipment. My VOX amps have become indispensable, both on stage and in the studio. There’s also a rich tonal quality to a VOX amp that is unique, and yet familiar. The VOX sound has become “my sound” and I’m absolutely thrilled to be a part of the VOX family of artists worldwide.”</em></p>
  <p>Bill Palmer is a guitarist, composer/musician, lecturer and an educational author. His style is a mix of rock tones, ambient sound-scapes and jazz-influenced harmony. Along similar stylistic lines to Joe Satriani and Eric Johnson but with a voice all his own, Bill's debut self-recorded album <em>&quot;Outlines&quot;</em> (ToneFreak Records, 2007) has garnered much critical acclaim from both music industry press and insiders and has been described as <em>“Classic Satch style shred...”</em> (Australian Guitar)</p>
  <p>Bill received a nomination and was a top 5 finalist in the <em>&quot;Jazz Classical&quot;</em> category of the 2008 Music OZ awards for his song <em>&quot;New Rays from a Distant Sun&quot;</em> and was a Top 50 entrant in the video category of the 2010 MusicOZ awards for his composition <em>&quot;Falling Free.&quot;</em> <em>&quot;New Rays from a Distant Sun&quot;</em> also received a commended entry award in the 2008 UK song writing competition. Also short-listed from over 3000 entrants to receive an APRA professional development award in March 2009, Bill was a top 10 nominee but unfortunately did not make the final 5.</p>
  <p>Bill is also an independently published author of 3 books; <em>&quot;Concepts of Jazz,&quot; &quot;The Intermediate Guitarists Compendium&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Outlines Addendum.&quot;</em></p>

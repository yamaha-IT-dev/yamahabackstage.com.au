      <p><em>“I have owned a variety of amps over the years, but nothing matches the smooth, ringing goodness of a cranking Vox. In the past, if we were playing gigs with a backline, and there was only one Vox, there was no chance of anyone else getting their hands on it!! If it's VOX! It rocks!!”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Having played in different sized venues, I’ve experienced many types of amps and I have to say, nothing comes close to plugging into a Vox. What sets Vox apart is its distinguished chime, superior clarity of tone and overall versatility.”</em></p>
      <p>Nato (Nathan) Hannaford is the guitarist in Sydney four-piece Battleships, his handiwork carrying the bands' haunting yet dynamic melody lines and the surging peaks that have become signature to their live show. </p>
      <p>He first picked up the guitar in 2003, and has spent much of the years since displaying his versatility on the instrument, while playing sessions across the musical genres - from indie-pop in underground city bars to high-energy country at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. His playing has accompanied the live sounds of Katy Ray, Phebe Star, Mickey Pye and Luke &amp; Joel (X Factor) both locally, nationally and in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Joining the Battleships line-up in early 2012, Nato has been busy recording and touring their unique sound ever since. The band’s first three singles 'In Retrospect', 'Your Words' and 'Coming Back To You' have earned high-rotation airplay on Triple J, as well as popular reception on the UK's BBC6 and College Radio in the US. These songs formed the basis of the 'Mini Album' entitled 'To You', which was released in October 2012 accompanied by a national tour. </p>
      <p>After topping off 2012 by winning the Triple J Unearthed slot at Homebake, Battleships went on to feature on the bill at Peats Ridge Festival. 2013 is shaping up to be another great year, with a schedule of festivals and a co-headliner national tour already underway. The latter half of the year will see the boys lock themselves away to workshop and record a much anticipated debut album. As the momentum, support and opportunity continues, Battleships are quickly becoming a noteworthy addition to the Australian music landscape. </p>

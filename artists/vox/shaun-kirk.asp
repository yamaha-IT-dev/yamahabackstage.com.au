      <h1>Shaun Kirk</h1>
      <p>Shaun plays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Night Train</li>
        <li>AC30</li>
        <li>AC4TVH / V112TV</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>“As a musician with a hectic touring schedule, my Vox amps take a fair beating and still never let me down. The tone that they deliver night after night is distinctive and truly satisfying. I swap and change between an AC30, Night Train and AC4TVH/V112TV combo and just can’t come to a conclusion as to which one is my favourite… I LOVE THEM ALL”</em></p>
      <p>Growing up an enthusiastic and successful sportsman, it wasn’t until a badly broken ankle at the age of seventeen forced him to sit still for a while, that Shaun Kirk discovered his passion for music. Having written his first song in a hospital bed whilst waiting for surgery, Shaun decided to experiment with his new-found love at many of Melbourne’s blues jam nights. Though at the time a folk singer, watching the more experienced artists jam their 12-bar tunes would later see Shaun realize an irrefutable feel for the blues.</p>
      <p>Since the independent release of his award winning debut album <em>‘Cruisin’</em> in 2010, Shaun has been captivating audiences across the country with his charming style of boogie blues &amp; soul. With a bevy of new material, Kirk’s first full-length album, <em>‘Thank You for Giving Me the Blues’</em> sees the twenty-four year old troubadour take a leap in musical maturity, with press labeling him as <em>“One of the finest blues voices this country has ever heard”</em> (Buzz Magazine) and <em>“The most interesting blues talent this country has seen in a long time”</em> (Matthew Frederick, PBS FM). The album, which offers seven original tracks and three covers, has all the passion and vigor you can ask for in a contemporary blues/soul record. Shaun’s blood, sweat and dedication to his art shines through; from slow and soulful ballads like <em>‘Find Somebody To Love’</em> to witty tales of life on the road in <em>‘Chicken &amp; Corn’</em>; raw, stripped back instrumentals like ‘The Howlin Harp Boogie’; and hard-hitting yet energetic grooves such as <em>‘The Drug Got a Hold Onto You’</em>. His innovative arrangements of old blues standards by the likes of Willie Dixon and Bo Diddley show his inclination to take the genre to places it hasn’t been. This production delivers not only emotive guitar playing and animated blues harmonica but enough thick drum/percussive grooves to inspire even the most docile listener to boogie. Topped off by a cameo performance with Australian blues legend Lloyd Spiegel and Shaun’s resilient, grinding vocal abilities, this is undoubtedly Kirk’s most accomplished work to date.</p>
      <p>Now a seasoned performer, Shaun is taking the <em>‘one man show’</em> concept to an exciting contemporary level. Surrounded by a stomp box, tambourine, high hat, cymbal, kick and snare drum, Shaun’s flair for playing six percussive sounds with his feet, whilst delivering quality guitar and blues- harmonica performances, is undeniably impressive!</p>
      <p>Dedication and hard work has seen Shaun earn numerous TV appearances and consistent airplay across Australia on Triple J, ABC Radio National, ABC Local and internationally, with <em>‘Thank You for Giving Me the Blues’</em> climbing to #1 on the Australian National Blues/Roots Airplay Charts in January 2012. His talent and expanding profile has led to recent billing with the likes of Eric Bibb, Ian Moss, Tex Perkins, Ash Grunwald, Dallas Frasca and Lloyd Spiegel as well as appearances at renowned festivals such as Bluesfest, Blues On Broadbeach, Australian Blues Festival, Queenscliff Music Festival, St Kilda Festival, Blues at Bridgetown, Cairns Blues Festival and Darwin Blues Festival. Shaun’s popularity and achievements, including the 2010 VIC/TAS Debut Blues Artist of the Year, look set to soar on what promises to be a very successful and prominent career.</p>

  <p><em>"I love both the feel and sound of my Paiste cymbals. I'm especially in love with the dark dry ride. The heavy, dark sound fits perfectly for our songs."</em></p>
  <p>It started in a shed on a family hobby farm in a tiny rural township just north of Melbourne. The shed, which housed little other than old furniture and a broken billiard table, was the obvious place in which to contain the inexpert bashings of four sisters. These four sisters would go on to become Australia earthen psych-rock opal, Stonefield.</p>
  <p>Stonefield have had a big year! From their Unearthed winning song Foreign Lover’ receiving massive Triple J support, to their infectious rock stomper ‘Through The Clover’ going on to sell huge numbers of their first EP, Stonefield was invited to showcase at the inaugural One Movement music and arts conference in Perth. Here they were approached by Martin Elbourne, a renowned UK band booker. Elbourne was so taken with their set that he signed Stonefield on to play the 2011 Glastonbury Festival in the UK on the spot.</p>
  <p>The rest of the band’s 2010/11 has been was spent playing their first (sold out) headline shows around Australia as well as supports with the Kaiser Chiefs, Cold Chisel, Jebediah and being introduced to major Australian festival crowds. They also had time to fit in a show at the Roxy in LA and have just finished the east coast dates of the Big Day Out.</p>
  <p>A double A-side single Blackwater Rising/ Yes Master was recorded with producer Scott Horscroft (Silverchair, The Presets) was the band’s first output on their new label. Wunderkind. Their introduction to UK audiences has also been made via their debut Through The Clover EP being released on boutique label Flock Records.</p>
  <p>Stonefield are recording the tracks of a new 6 track mini album with Lindsay Gravina at Birdland Studios with the first single Bad Reality due out late February.</p>
  <p>At home, they still write and practice in the shed, their explosive jams reverberating out across the paddocks. The only difference now is that we all get to share in rock’n’roll’s newest family story.</p>

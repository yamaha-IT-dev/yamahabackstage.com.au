      <p><em>“My two biggest influences have always been Stewart Copeland and my father... and they both play Paiste!”</em></p>
      <p>Dave Jenkins Jr has been drumming for as long as he can remember. Growing up with a talented drummer dad, in a household full of drums, it was inevitable that he would jump behind the kit himself.</p>
      <p>Jenkins Jr started his first band at the age of 8 playing Beatles and Nirvana songs, and went on to form Sydney indie bands The Inheritors and Young Romantics.</p>
      <p>More recently, Dave has hit the skins and toured with accomplished artists Andy Bull, Bertie Blackman, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kirin J Callinan and X-factor winners Reece Mastin, Samantha Jade and Dami Im.</p>
      <p>Dave Jenkins Jr’s relaxed yet energetic style has gone on to earn him a worthy reputation as one of Australia’s most sought after session musicians.</p></div>

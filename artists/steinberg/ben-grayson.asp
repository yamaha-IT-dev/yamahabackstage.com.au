  <h1>Ben Grayson</h1>
  <h4>The Bamboos</h4>
  <p>Ben uses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cubase</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>&quot;I've been a Cubase user since 1999. Steinberg has consistently delivered the most intuitive DAW year after year. For all my productions, from high profile TV work (X-Factor/Australia's Got Talent), TVC's, scores, to remixes, Cubase has always been my workhorse.&quot;</em></p>
  <p>Ben Grayson has been a stalwart on the Melbourne scene for nearly 20 years. He is a true chameleon, switching between pop, rock, jazz, soul and funk with ease and becoming one of the in-demand new breed of Australian musicians. As a founding member of the Bamboos he lit up dance floors across Australia and Europe with his Hammond organ skills and a long tenureship with electro pop icons Pseudo Echo has shown he is equally at home on a keytar.</p>
  <p>In 2005 under the moniker <em>'Bennson'</em>, Grayson released the critically acclaimed boogie/soul record <em>'Let The Love'</em> on seminal Swedish label Raw Fusion. A three year stint in Berlin saw Grayson touring with German mega pop star Sarah Conner and nu-jazz legends Jazzanova. Recently Grayson has been performing with international acts like Omar (UK), Bilal (US), and Martha Wainwright (US). Regular contributions to X-Factor and Australia's Got Talent, both producing and performing live, well and truly establish Grayson as a heavyweight on the Australian musical landscape.</p>

  <h1>Mathieu Valton</h1>
  <h4>Hykus / Jump The Gun</h4>
  <p>Mathieu uses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cubase</li>
    <li>HALion Sonic</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>&quot;Steinberg are the creators of VST and have the highest standard of products. I wouldn’t be this far in my career without them.&quot;</em></p>
  <p>You may not know his name as yet, but Mathieu Valton is quite possibly the busiest man in Australian dance music. The Perth producer is an in-demand production gun for hire with a who’s who of Australian stars as clients. </p>
  <p>The 30-year-old has been honing his production chops for 15 years now, initially turning to the boards for his hip hop crew when he realised that his skills lay with beat-making, not rhyming. Since then he’s supported some of the finest names from across the hip hop and dance music spectrum including Knife Party, M-Phazes, Caspa, Sampology, LTJ Bukem and Laidback Luke.</p>
  <p>Though his current agenda may seem to position him at the more mainstream end of the EDM spectrum, Mathieu’s work under Hykus and Jump The Gun monikers is anything but. “Broken beat, bass music I guess you could call it,” he says of the music he’s currently producing. <em>“But honestly I write music… music I love to make according to time, mood &amp; environment.”</em></p>
  <p>The young gun is working behind the scenes for the live incarnation of Jump The Gun, which will see him joined onstage by drummer Adam Fish to work through all of the tracks in his catalogue – from filtered French funk to deep techno to drum’n’bass and beyond.</p>

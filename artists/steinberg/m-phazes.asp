      <h1>M-Phazes</h1>      
      <p>M-Phazes usess:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cubase</li>
        <li>HALion Sonic</li>
      </ul>      
      <p><em>&quot;Cubase provides enough features for me to do whatever I want within a production, from complex automation, to easy side chaining and routing options, nothing is unachievable. The new VST effects and instruments that come standard with Cubase 6 are amazing!&quot;</em></p>
      <p>Drawing inspiration from legendary producers such as <strong>Battlecat, Pete Rock</strong> and the late <strong>J-Dilla</strong>, M-Phazes has formulated his own sound over the years that can be defined by soulful melodies coupled with loose, smacking drums. Landing his first U.S. placement in 2005 on Supastition’s “<em>Chain Letters</em>”, M-Phazes has been on a steady climb and hasn't looked back. In March of 2008, M-Phazes earned himself a first place victory at Sha Money's prestigious <em>One Stop Shop Producers Conference Beat Battle</em>, an event that's held annually in Phoenix, Arizona. M-Phazes' production was judged by a panel of legendary producers and artists that consisted of <strong>DJ Premier, 9th Wonder, Swizz Beats, DJ Toomp, No I.D, Hi-Tek, Don Cannon, Chamillionaire</strong> and of course, <strong>Sha Money</strong>.</p>
      <p>Since the <strong>One Stop</strong>, M-Phazes has received an Aria Award and a gold record for his production on Bliss N Eso's &quot;Flying Colors album, has had his production featured on two college chart topping singles, has signed a landmark deal with Mushroom Publishing and has landed several placements, including a major label placement with Amerie (Feenix Rising Entertainment/Island Def Jam Music Group) as well as a co-production credit alongside super producer JR Rotem (Belugah Heights) for his artist <strong>Mann</strong>.</p>
      <p>To date, M-Phazes has built a very strong discography that includes placements with several key players in today's hip-hop marketplace that include <strong>Pharoahe Monch, CL Smooth, M.O.P., Mela Machinko, Royce Da 5'9&quot;, Emilio Rojas, Heltah Skeltah, Donny Goines, Cory Gunz, Elzhi (Slum Village), Freeway, Marvin Priest (son of Maxi Priest), Termanology, Sean Price, Sadat X</strong> and more.</p>

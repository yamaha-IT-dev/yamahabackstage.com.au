  <h1>DJ Morgs - Thundamentals</h1>
  <p><em>“I have been using Cubase for 10 years, its usability and stability with large projects is amazing, the workflow it enables is unparalleled.”</em></p>
  <p>Primarily known as the production brains-trust for Blue Mountains Hip Hop crew Thundamentals, DJ Morgs has received critical acclaim for the groups 4 releases to date. Their most recent release was 2014’s <em>’So We Can Remember’</em> which topped the charts, stormed the nominations lists. </p>
  <p>As well as handling deck duties for the Thundamentals live shows, DJ Morgs has supported the likes of DJ Cash Money, Lord Finesse, DJ Premier, Q-Bert, Supernatural, Hermitude and The Herd to name a few. He has appeared doing cuts on Skryptah and Spit Syndicate’s latest albums and toured as a DJ with Ozi Batla and Tuka.</p>
  <p>Conducting an orchestra of samples and beats weighing on influences from 60’s and 70’s soul/psychedelic to Latin rhythms and bass heavy synthesizers, DJ Morgs creates music that is at once unique and soul-style earnest and yet entirely hip hop driven. With his solo debut beat-tape currently in the works featuring appearances by some of Sydney’s best up and coming artists and a variety of other collaborations underway, watch this space for more releases, news and shows.</p>

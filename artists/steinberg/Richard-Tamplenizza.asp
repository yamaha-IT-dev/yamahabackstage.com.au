      <p><em>&quot;Cubase has been my DAW of choice for more than ten years. It has class-leading midi and audio capabilities. The interface is intuitive and the sheer power of the software has gotten me through some big recording and mixing sessions. Everything from complex album productions through to full-blown film compositions.‚Äù&quot;</em></p>

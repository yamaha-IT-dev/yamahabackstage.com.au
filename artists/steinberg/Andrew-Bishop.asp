  <h1>Andrew Bishop</h1>
  <h4>Independent</h4>
  <p>Andrew uses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cubase</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>''After using many a DAW over the years, Cubase always seems to fill the gaps missing in other DAWs with functionality and usability. To me, it simply covers every aspect a modern day composer/producer requires to make to music!''</em></p>
  <p>From a relatively young age, Andrew has spent most of his musical time dabbling around the Melbourne music scene performing in various bands, engineering both live and in the studio mixing/mastering for various musical acts both locally and from afar. In addition, Andrew's long time experience in this area has seen him often sort after for audio tech support from many musical performers and producers as well as running educational training in selected schools around Victoria, Australia. Using predominantly Steinberg Software such as Cubase, Andrew is credited to producing and engineering records that has led him on to take part in large tours over Australia and Europe with various bands such as hard rock outfit COPIA as well as working with worldwide established artists such as Australian renowned beatbox performer DubFX. When not on the touring road Andrew composes and produce's music and sound design for feature films and worldwide TV commercials which has included the halftime for the US superbowl NFL as well as the AFL finals in Australia.

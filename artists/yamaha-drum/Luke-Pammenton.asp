  </ul>
  <p>Luke has been playing drums since the age of nine, but it was only after a move from England to Australia in 2000 that drummers such as Dave Weckl and Mike Portnoy inspired him to focus on music as a profession. After graduating high school, Luke was accepted into the Queensland Conservatorium of Music where he majored in jazz drums and contemporary music to attain a Bachelor of Music in performance and a Master of Music Studies. </p>
  <p>Luke is currently working with the Brisbane based rock/metal outfit Silence The Sun where he brings a drumming style that is rich with metal, jazz and funk elements. Their debut album (recorded at Loose Stones Studios and mixed by J.R. McNeely) is in the final stages of production with a release expected late in 2015.</p>
  <p>Luke has also just joined and finished recording a new EP with MofoIsDead. The first single is set to be released on January 30th 2015 with the EP coming out sometime in March. The new EP will feature a more progressive sound than their debut album 'Nubile' which was described as <em>&quot;a schizophrenic orgy of sonic debauchery&quot; </em></p>
  <p>He is also the long time drummer for The Soundscapes trio, led by versatile pianist and composer Cleon Barraclough. Their music pushes the boundaries of the jazz trio format with complex progressive compositions contrasting beautiful serene passages with angular technical experimentation and improvisation. They are set to release their 2nd album in 2015 and a promotional tour of Australia is also in the works. The group's debut album <em>“Globalectic”</em> (2013) received many positive reviews. </p>
  <p>Luke is also a respected session musician and educator in Brisbane and runs his own teaching studio providing lessons to over 30 students per week.</p>

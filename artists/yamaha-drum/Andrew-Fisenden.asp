      <p>Andrew is a drummer focused on becoming influential in his generation. His natural attraction to the drums was evident by the age of three. By the age of five he was playing drums in his church. Now at the age of 24, Andrew has developed his craft to a level that demands attention from the world's best musicans.</p>
      <p>Tutored by David Garibaldi, Chriss Tarr, Darryn Farrugia, Andrew Gander, Gordon Rytmeister and Terepai Richmond, Andrew won both the 2003 James Morrison Scholarship and 1999 Australia's Best Up &amp; Coming Drummer award. Since these prestigous accolades Andrew has developed a playing history worthy that is extremely impressive. Recordings with Kate Ceberano and James Morrison, international tours with VOID and K, DVD recordings and drum magazine interviews are all notable achivements in his short playing career. Andrew is now current drummer for James Morrison and Kate Ceberano.</p>

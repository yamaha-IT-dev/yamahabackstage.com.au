      <p><em>“Yamaha drums really are the most versatile drums on the market. You can see in their diverse range of artists, huge catalogue of drums, outstanding craftsmanship and the fact that they have been in the business for more the 40 years. For me, they tune well at any pitch, contain detailed timbre and sonic qualities and work well in any musical format.”</em></p>

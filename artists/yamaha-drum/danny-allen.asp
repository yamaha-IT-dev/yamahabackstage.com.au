  <h1>Danny Allen</h1>
  <h4>Youth Group / The Drums</h4>
  <p>Danny plays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MAPLE CUSTOM ABSOLUTE (Silver Sparkle)</li>
    <li>22 x 18 bass drum</li>
    <li>13 x 9 tom</li>
    <li>15 x 14 floor tom</li>
    <li>16 x 16 floor tom</li>
    <li>14 x 7 snare</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>&quot;The Yamaha Oak Custom was always my drum of choice when hiring gear. Now with my Maple Custom Absolute, I am proud to have that reliably fantastic sound every time we play.&quot;</em></p>
  <p>Initially Danny's attraction to drums began with hip-hop. It wasn't until he was older that he realised it was the beats and furthermore, the samples, of the amazing drum sounds of loads of legendary 50's and 60's artists that he was really attracted to, rather than the electronic aspect. From there, like most young audiophiles, and with the help of bands like The Stone Roses, Danny fell in love with guitar-driven bands with very tasteful drummers and, although learning guitar first as some sort of starting point, his first kit would arrive as soon as he could afford it.</p>
  <p>Being self-taught, Danny was always very careful with what he practised to and was therefore influenced by. Playing along to bands like Built To Spill and Pavement were a huge influnce and a great way to get his head around a basic kit set up, without even feeling like he was practising. Within months of buying his first kit, Youth Group had formed and were rehearsing Toby's songs with their first gig not long after. There's no faster way to learn than playing on stage and that's pretty much how it happened for Danny. </p>

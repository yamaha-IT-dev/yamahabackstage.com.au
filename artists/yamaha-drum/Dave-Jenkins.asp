  <h1>Dave Jenkins</h1>
  <h4>Kirin J Callinan / Dami IM / Bertie Blackman / Reece Mastin</h4>
  <p>Dave plays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maple Custom Absolute</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>“I’ve always found Yamaha kits to be the most reliable kits. If I’m paying at festivals, on televisions, or in the studio… if there’s a yami there I know I will be fine”</em></p>
  <p>Dave Jenkins Jr has been drumming for as long as he can remember. Growing up with a talented drummer dad, in a household full of drums, it was inevitable that he would jump behind the kit himself.</p>
  <p>Jenkins Jr started his first band at the age of 8 playing Beatles and Nirvana songs, and went on to form Sydney indie bands The Inheritors and Young Romantics.</p>
  <p>More recently, Dave has hit the skins and toured with accomplished artists Daniel Johns, Andy Bull, Bertie Blackman, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kirin J Callinan and X-factor winners Reece Mastin, Samantha Jade and Dami Im.</p>
  <p>Dave Jenkins Jr’s relaxed yet energetic style has gone on to earn him a worthy reputation as one of Australia’s most sought after session musicians.</p>

  <p><em>&quot;Yamaha drum design is practical and beautiful. Logical mounting systems, and it's famously rugged hardware are case in point. Those distinct touches of well-engineered class put it ahead of other brands for me. The clincher of course, is the superb musicality of the drum's sound in any genre. Its gorgeous looks are a bonus.&quot;</em></p>

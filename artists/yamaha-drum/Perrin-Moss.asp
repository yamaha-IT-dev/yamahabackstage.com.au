      <p>Perrin Moss is a self-taught drummer and producer from the Blue Mountains, Australia. </p>
      <p>Originally a hip-hop producer, Moss counts some of the world’s most acclaimed drummers and producers as his fans (Questlove, Pharrell Williams, Erykah Badu, Chris Daddy Dave, Flying Lotus) </p>
      <p>Moss acts as producer / drummer for Melbourne neo-soul outfit Hiatus Kaiyote, signed to Flying Buddha Records, an imprint of Sony Music by Salaam Remi (Amy Winehouse, The Fugees, Nas, Miguel). </p>
      <p>A collaboration on the track ‘Nakamarra’ with A Tribe Called Quest legend Q-Tip on their re-release of debut self-produced record Tawk Tomahawk earned Hiatus Kaiyote a Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance, making Australian history as the first Australians to be nominated for any R&amp;B category. </p>
      <p>In addition to Hiatus Kaiyote, Moss has a side project Clever Austin, a nine-piece instrumental group playing original productions. </p>
      <p>Moss is currently touring with Hiatus Kaiyote across most parts of the known world, in aid of their first full length album Choose Your Weapon (out May 2015). </p>

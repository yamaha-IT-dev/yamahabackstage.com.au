      <p><em>&quot;I've always been a fan of Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Linda Ronstadt and in particular the drumming of Russ Kunkel (who was also rumoured to be the drummer on The Church's Under the Milky Way). Russ used Yamaha drums which peaked my interest - and it was cemented when I found out that Tony Thompson (Chic) also used Yamaha drums. I love the vintage look of my silver sparkle Absolute Hybrid Maple kit - it plays like a dream and has amazing hardware&quot;</em></p>

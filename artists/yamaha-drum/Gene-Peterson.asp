      <p>As a musician, Gene is a virtuosic percussionist, an exceptional pianist, and a masterful entertainer. He has toured throughout Australia, Europe, Asia, America and The Middle East, delivering well over 1000 shows and workshops across 30 tours in the past 7 years alone.

      <p>Aside from his successes as a touring artist, Gene is also an award winning composer, and at just 14 years of age, had his work ‘Raindance’ performed by the Darwin Symphony Orchestra. He has since been commissioned to compose the scores for several theatre shows, and has even had his works performed on Broadway.</p>
      <p>As a producer, Gene has established a solid reputation for outstanding productions targeting the youth/family demographic. In 2011, he founded Onyx Productions, which within its’ first three years of operation, has produced 4 different shows, coordinated 13 major tours across Australia, Europe, Asia &amp; America, and has delivered over 800 performances and workshops!</p>
      <p>Gene currently tours as the drummer in his latest show 360 ALLSTARS, which features two world champion break-dancers, the two-time world champion BMX flatlander, a basketball freestyler, a roué cyr artist and a beat-boxing vocal loop artist, in a radical urban circus!</p>

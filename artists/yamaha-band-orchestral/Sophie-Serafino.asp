      <p><em>&quot;A violinist, singer and composer, Sophie has been described by the Daily Telegraph Australia as 'inimitable', by the Sydney Morning Herald as 'refreshing' and by writer Gail Kavanagh as 'one of the few who deserve the title of diva'.&quot;</em></p>

      <p>Sophie commands the stage with power and charisma, without boundaries, and as Robert O'Brien from Black &amp; White Magazine Australia says, 'if flame haired violinist Serafino can lead that audience to a place where classical meets pop and rock, the rest is easy, this girl is set to leave her mark in the international music scene,'.</p>
      <p>A violinist, singer and composer, Sophie has been described by the Daily Telegraph Australia as 'inimitable', by the Sydney Morning Herald as 'refreshing' and by writer Gail Kavanagh as 'one of the few who deserve the title of diva'.</p>
      <p>She's pumped it up at the DJ desk New Years Eve 2008 in Istanbul, performed sitting atop a trapeze in Rome and moshed with the crowds in Germany. Sophie displays a huge polarity of emotion taking the audience on a journey from her wild energy and defiant character to the huge vulnerability she displays in some of her songs.</p>
      <p>Fearless in her technical assault, intriguing with her warm and witty connections and passionate in her performance, she transforms not only of herself but takes everyone along the journey.</p>
      <p>Sophie has performed all over the world, for dignitaries the Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed at the Emirates Palace in Sao Paolo Brazil, the Bahraini Royal Family and Australian Ambassador of Turkey, and in May 2009 was invited to perform for Crown Prince &amp; Princess Mary &amp; Frederick of Denmark.</p>
      <p>Sophie is frequently dressed by fashion designers including Roberto Cavalli, John Galliano, Stephen Fuller (Bondinage), jeweler Nic Cerrone and is recognized as a muse and musical style icon appearing in magazines all over the world from Black &amp; White to Esquire.</p>
      <p>Sophie has performed more than 400 concerts around the globe and also works as a session musician for EMI and Warner Music Artists including Goldfrapp and The Veronicas. </p>
      <p>Sophie's musical style has evolved after years of technical experimentation with many musical genres, has been described as entirely unique. Sophie mixes world music with rock, dance, some Middle Eastern influence and classically inspired strings.</p>

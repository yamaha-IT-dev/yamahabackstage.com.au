      <p>Fletcher plays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>YEP-642II Neo Euphonium</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>“The Yamaha Neo euphonium combines a smooth even response through the entire range; warm, rich tone; wonderful resonant low and mid-range sound; great singing high register; smooth valve action providing the ease to play rapid, technically demanding passages; and accurate intonation across all registers. It is a versatile instrument that provides me the flexibility to perform with wind bands, brass bands, small chamber ensembles and as a soloist.”</em></p>
      <p>Fletcher Mitchell is an Australian based euphonium player who is quickly making a name for himself as a soloist and low brass educator. He has given master classes and performed as a guest soloist with some of the top wind ensembles and brass bands across Australia. He has performed throughout Australia, Asia, USA and Canada as a soloist and with the Royal Australian Navy Band. </p>

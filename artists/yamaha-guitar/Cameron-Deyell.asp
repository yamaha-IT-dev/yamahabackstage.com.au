      <p>&quot;I'm an electric guitarist, and absolutely my favourite thing about this Silent guitar is how I can run it straight through my electric rig and make some original and cool sounds. I'm using it all the time for writing, it's a versatile tool; and I'm finding it's a stress-free, no-feedback, solid acoustic sound on big stages. This guitar looks like nothing else and gets a lot of comments!&quot;</p>

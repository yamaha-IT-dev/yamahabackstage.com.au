      <p><em>"I find the Yamaha acoustic/electric A.R.T pickup system to be the finest reproduction of an acoustic guitar on the market today"</em></p>
      <p>Brandon Lewis is half of Electrifying guitar duo Aires Linares. Their original compositions rely heavily upon strong pulsating rhythms that draw on influences from Spanish, rock, hip-hop, Latin, and modern jazz music. These influences are also reflected in their  modern interpretations of classic popular repertoire.</p>
      <p>Formed in 2011, Aires Linares sees the coming together of two distinct musical talents. Brandon Lewis comes from a Latin jazz background, studying this discipline at the Victorian College of the Arts, and further pursuing his passion for this genre of music through his involvement in various Latin bands over the past 20 years. Nathan Sinclair’s musical education comes  from a more classical Spanish background which has seem him perform  internationally both as a soloist and with orchestras and garner prizes in major guitar competitions around the world.</p>
      <p>From this combined wealth of musical experience, Aires Linares deliver stirring  performances that exhibit an unparalleled level of technical virtuosity at the  heart of which lies a deep emotive core.</p>

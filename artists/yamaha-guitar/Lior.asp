            <p>Lior burst onto the Australian music scene in 2005 with his stunning debut album - 'Autumn Flow'. Recorded and released entirely independently, and spearheaded by 'This Old Love' and subsequent singles 'Daniel' and 'Autumn Flow', the album became one of the most successful independent debuts in Australian history with sales surpassing Platinum. A swag of accolades followed, amongst them three Aria nominations (including Best Male Artist), as well as Triple J's prestigious 'J Award' nomination for Album of the Year.</p>
            <p>'Autumn Flow' signalled the arrival of one of Australia's most respected and loved singer/songwriters, showcasing an artist that has gone on to create a varied and diverse musical legacy. Alongside his highly acclaimed albums and live projects, Lior penned and sang the much loved closing track 'Hoot’s Lullaby' to the ABC Children’s show 'Giggle and Hoot'. 'Hey Hootabelle', another Lior track commissioned by the ABC for the show went on to win the coveted 'Best Original Song Composed for the Screen' at the 2012 APRA Screen Music Awards.</p>
            <p>In April 2015, Lior was invited as the sole Australian artist to perform at the prestigious 100 year anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli, performing his song 'Safety of Distance' with the Gallipoli choir leading in to the dawn service. Most artists set out with an ambition to build a career based on musical credibility and integrity whilst maintaining an independence and individuality in their craft. Lior is certainly part of that rare breed that has achieved this whilst garnering a great degree of success and critical acclaim.</p>
            <p>In 2016, Lior co-wrote his first theatre score for the play 'The Wider Earth' with producer Tony Buchen. Written and directed by David Morton, the play traces the voyage of Charles Darwin and premieres at the Queensland Theatre Company. Lior also made his music theatre debut in 2016, performing the role of Mottel in the Australian production of 'Fiddler on the Roof' alongside Anthony Warlow and Sigrid Thornton.</p>
            <p>Lior is currently working on an album for the HUSH Foundation. The project is centred on songs written by Lior in collaboration with Sydney based vocal group 'The Idea of North' and composer Elena Katz Churnin. The lyrics are based on answers to questions delivered to sick young kids at the Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital Cancer Ward. The HUSH project has a dual purpose of both creating music to provide a better environment in the wards as well as raise funds for these wards. The album is set for release in late 2016 and will be accompanied by a series of concerts. Lior is set to write and record his fifth studio album in the latter half of 2016.</p>

  <h1>Dr. Glen Hodges</h1>
  <p>Glen plays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SA2200</li>    
  </ul>
  <p><em>“For me playability is at least as important as tone. A lot of a person’s unique sound comes from their hands but if the instrument hampers the technical freedom of your playing, everything else suffers and the artist is unable to express the full range of their musical potential. Yamaha electric guitars are the absolute finest of their kind anywhere. They provide a design, build and set up that enables the artist to speak in their particular musical dialect with ease and freedom. The fact that on top of this they sound phenomenal is a welcome bonus. I consider many of the models Yamaha has introduced over the years to be true classics and instruments worthy of “hall of fame” status. Their place in the development of modern music is irrefutable.”</em></p>
  <p>Glen is the Deputy Head of Music at The University of Tasmania, Conservatorium of Music and is Coordinator of Contemporary Guitar and the Songwriter program.</p>

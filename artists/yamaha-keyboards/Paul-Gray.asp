      <h1>Paul Gray</h1>
      <h2>Marcia Hines / Tina Arena / Damien Leith / Human Nature / Countdown Spectacular</h2>
      <p>Paul plays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>S90ES</li>
        <li>MOTIF XS8</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>&quot;I really like the action on the S90ES - it's the best of all the weighted keyboards out there. And the Motif has been fantastic for some of the recent tours I've done. Simple access to great banks of sounds is very handy on stage, while being able to save favourites to a User area quickly and easily means my sounds are perfect wherever I travel.&quot;</em></p>
      <p>After a high school education spent mainly on the piano, Paul studied at the Sydney Conservatorium's Jazz Program and for a few years was on the cruise ship and club circuit in Asia and the U.S. In the late 80s he formed Wa Wa Nee and as lead singer, songwriter and producer achieved considerable success in Australasia, Europe, Asia and the U.S. With hits like 'Stimulation' and 'Sugarfree' (Top 20 in the U.S), the band produced three albums and toured worldwide from 1986 until 1991.</p>
      <p>In the early 90s as a staff songwriter for MCA Music, LA, he wrote and produced various hits for acts such as Cherelle and Five Star, and contributed songs to some Hollywood movies. Back in Australia from 1995 Paul has written and/or produced records for Bardot, Scandal'us (including #1 single <em>&quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;</em>), Kate Ceberano, Rani (including Top 10 hit &quot;Always on my Mind&quot;), Jon Stevens, Nissan Cedrics, C.D.B (including the hits <em>'Hook Me Up'</em> and <em>'Hey Girl'</em>) and Tina Arena. He has also toured as a Musical Director and/or keyboardist for many of the above as well as Damien Leith, Countdown Spectacular, Bardot, Marcia Hines, Renee Geyer, Anthony Callea and Human Nature. In 1996 he was MD for the ABC TV Series <em>&quot;Kate Ceberano and Friends&quot;</em> and in 2002 for the CD release of Tina Arena <em>Live at the Olympia Theatre, Paris</em>. Paul also boasts credits in advertising music from 1999 to 2005 and has worked commercials for <em>Qantas, Motorola, Misubishi, VW, Nokia, Citibank, St George Bank, Sony, Canon</em> and many others.</p></div>

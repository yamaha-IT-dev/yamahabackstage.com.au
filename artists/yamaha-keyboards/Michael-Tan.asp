            "Yamaha synthesisers are the perfect combination of versatility and quality.<br><br>
            The Motif’s Piano and Rhodes samples are the best in the business, and the acoustic instruments and synth libraries are very comprehensive. But for me, the standout feature is the integration of all of these sounds into a powerful workstation, which allows me to split and layer multiple voices, create signal chains with insert effects, while adjusting parameters in real-time.<br><br>
            In a nutshell, Yamaha workstations give me the power to perform live in a huge range of styles, and be confident that it will sound world class every time… exactly as it should!"

      <p><em>“I love using my Yamaha keyboard for performances – it now feels like an old friend and I love using the weighted keys. I write all of my songs on my Yamaha Clavinova and wouldn’t want to write on anything else”</em></p>
      <p>At just 13 years old, Frank Dixon is one of Australia’s fastest rising singer / songwriters. Frank began writing music at the age of 9 and professionally recorded two songs, <em>“Up and Away”</em> and <em>“Moving On”</em> when he was 11 years old.</p>
      <p>In 2010 Frank was awarded the junior singer/songwriter prize at <em>“Dream Inc”</em> and it was at this competition that he was first noticed by David Jaanz (Jaanz School of Singing) – who remains Frank’s vocal coach and mentor.</p>
      <p>In 2011 Frank was scouted on YouTube by a Canadian talent scout and producer. Frank is now travelling between Melbourne and Los Angeles recording his music with Grammy Award winning producers First Born, Devine Evans and Grammy nominated producer Dre Knight in addition to Australian producers Lee Bradshaw and Jennifer Matthews from Bignote Productions. His singles, <em>“Toorak Girl”</em> and <em>“Step into the Dark”</em> have been serviced nationally.</p>

      <p>Frank was recently awarded 1st Place in the Australian Song writing Association Awards for the Under 18 Category for his original song “Step Into the Dark”.

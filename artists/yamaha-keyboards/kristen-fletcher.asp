      <p><em>“Yamaha has served me well for years, from the incredibly believable piano and Rhodes sounds to the versatility of the synths. But I mainly love the performance and layering function &amp; its ease of use to create my own unique sounds built with Yamaha’s strong selection of voices.”</em></p>
      <p>Kristen has been playing piano since the tender age of six. After receiving classical training for 12 years, Kristen then went on to explore her passion for jazz, soul &amp; pop music and has never looked back. It was during this period that she began writing her own material &amp; singing became a natural result of her desire to communicate with her audience. Now, Kristen performs as both a keyboardist &amp; singer, having shared the stage with some of Australia’s finest including Dami Im, Samantha Jade, Bertie Blackman, Urthboy and recently International pop star Hilary Duff.</p>
      <p>Fronting her own trio, Kristen brings together all her influences to create a new &amp; refreshing sound. The trio has been working around Sydney performing Kristen's unique versions of current pop tunes &amp; soulful classics. Her performances are something to be experienced – an exciting, largely improvised concoction of great songs! The past two years have been exciting for Kristen &amp; her trio, with the recording &amp; release of their debut originals album and a tour to the Philippines under their belt. Her influences stem from a wide musical palette, including the likes of Stevie Wonder, Chick Corea, Robert Glasper and electro-pop duo, Bird &amp; the Bee.</p>

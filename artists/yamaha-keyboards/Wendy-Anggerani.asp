      <p><em>“The YAMAHA Motif range has some of the best sounds. My favourite patches are the DX sounds and the orchestral strings and brass. The MOTIF XF’s are handy for touring because you can carry your sounds and settings on the USB.”</em></p>

In 2007 Wendy toured around China and South East Asia. She performed with Asia Beat's <em>Lewis Pragasam</em> in Malaysia and Indonesia at The Java Jazz Festival.</p>
      <p>Wendy is currently involved in original projects with Wendy Katz and SSJ.</p>

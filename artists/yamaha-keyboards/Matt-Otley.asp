      <p>Matt plays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CVP609GP</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>“The CVP 609, along with Cubase offers an extraordinarily powerful armory for composers. For work-shopping ideas the CVP 609 is intuitive and there is no disruption to the creative flow. With a few finger taps I can change orchestrations, pushing my ideas to the limit. Mozart would’ve killed for an instrument like this and doubled his output.”</em></p>
      <p>Matt Ottley is a multi-modal artist working across the fields of music, visual arts and literature. He is an award winning picture book writer and illustrator, having had 25 picture books published. He spent his childhood in Papua New Guinea, and has travelled widely throughout Australia and the world. As a teenager and during his early twenties he worked as a stockman on remote cattle stations in the Australian outback, before studying fine arts and music at The Julian Ashton School of Art and Wollongong University.</p>
      <p>Matt lived for three years in Britain working as an equestrian painter, painting some of Britain’s finest racehorses and polo ponies. His controversial book and musical work for young adults, Requiem for a Beast was awarded the Children’s Book Council of Australia’s Picture Book of the Year in 2008, and the Queensland Premier’s Award for Young Adult Literature in the same year. Matt’s work has been translated into many languages and his picture book, What Faust Saw was an international best seller. Matt has also worked as a professional flamenco and classical guitarist. He is currently working on two large-scale orchestral projects that will also have visual and literature components.</p>

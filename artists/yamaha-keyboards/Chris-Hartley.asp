      <h1>Chris Hartley</h1>
      <p>Chris plays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MOTIF ES8 (+ drum &amp; piano plug-in cards)</li>
        <li>MOTIF ES6 (+ violin plug-in card)</li>
        <li>CS2X</li>
        <li>S90</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>&quot;I can go to any type of gig knowing I have the best sounds on the planet in one keyboard. The MOTIF ES is my dream machine, whether it be a country gig or full-on rock gig. Even in my studio, this synth gives me the professional sounds I need. The factory presets are great and the support from <a href="http://www.motifator.com/" target="_blank">Motifator</a> keep this synth way ahead of other brands.&quot;</em></p>
      <p>Chris Hartley has been a professional musician for many years. With humble beginnings playing melodica in the Chinchilla Primary School Band, to playing opening act with Swanee for the ledgendary <em>Deep Purple</em> and <em>Status Quo</em>, he has come a long way. Basically a self taught musician, he learnt his skills through listening to recordings of Gregg Rolie (Santana), Steve Winwood, Sam Mcnally (Stylus), Greg Allman, Jimmy Smith, Jan Hammer, Floyd Cramer. </p>
      <p>Chris has toured with Phil Emmanuel, James Blundell, The Eagles Experience, Adam Brand and Keri McInerney, and international acts such as 60s rockers Johnny Tillotson and Dennis Knight.</p>
      <p>Attributed to his dedication to his music and ability to play all genres, Chris is always in demand for touring acts and session work. Chris also has a recording studio called Rock The House Productions which is a one-man show. According to Chris, <em>&quot;With the great sounds now available on keyboards, you can cover a lot more instruments rather than just piano and organ both live and in the studio.&quot; </em></p>

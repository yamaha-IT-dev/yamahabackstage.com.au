But his real love for music is traditional R'n'B, jazz and funk. Michael has taken lessons from jazz gurus such as Mike Nock, Paul McNamara and Chuck Yates.</p>
      <p>Over the last five years Michael has earnt the respect as a session keyboard player which has given him the privilege of working with some very talented artists. He has played with <em>Casey Donovan, Human Nature, Disco Montego, Melissa Tallon</em> and <em>Deni Hines</em>. Michael is currently touring nationally with <em>Shannon Noll</em>, and <em>Ricki-Lee</em>. Michael also has a professional studio which he writes and produces his own material.</p>

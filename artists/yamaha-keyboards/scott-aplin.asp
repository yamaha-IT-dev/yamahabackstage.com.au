      <h1>Scott Aplin (Noiseworks / The Voice Australia)</h1>
      <p>Scott plays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MOTIF XS7</li>
        <li>MOTIF XS8</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>&quot;I've been fortunate enough to use a good range of Yamaha keyboards and I always find them perfectly suited to the job. My current choice is the XS7 - its incredible collection of quality sounds and clever sampling technology makes it the ideal choice for any gig!&quot;</em></p>
      <p>Scott is currently the music director for The Voice Australia and plays keys in The Voice live band. Other artists he works with include <em>Silverchair, Jimmy Barnes</em> and <em>Noiseworks</em>. Aside from live performance, Scott is often based in the studio as a writer and producer. He has produced a number of albums for the ABC Kids label, written for film and television, and collaborated on many recordings for both independent and high profile artists.</p>

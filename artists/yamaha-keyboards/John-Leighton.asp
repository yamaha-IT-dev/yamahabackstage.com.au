  <h1>John Leighton</h1>
  <h4>The Smart / Citipointe</h4>
  <p>John plays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MOTIF XS8</li>
    <li>MOTIF ES8</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>&quot;I know it, you know it - the professional series of synths that Yamaha produce are just ace compared to everything else out there!&quot;</em></p>
  <p>Brisbane-born John Leighton lives and breathes music with an almost diabolical energy. While that energy may been responsible for his reputation for his dynamic live shows, it's the slick, sharp, inventive technique and intuitive musicality that fills out the sound of his four piece pop/rock outfit, The Smart, that has led to two tours of the US while still independent. </p>
  <p>With the world's best producers now clamouring to bottle his sound, John's directing his energy into the studio, with an album for The Smart - think driving, powerful rock kicked out by a solid rhythm section, a nod to the modern orchestral romanticism of the eighties via the keys and a male vocalist who's not afraid to wail - only months away. And while John lightly cites world domination through touring and recording as his ultimate goal, it's clearly the original passion that shines through - it's always, always the music first.</p>

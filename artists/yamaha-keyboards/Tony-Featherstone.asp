      <p><em>“The thing that matters most to me as a working musician is reliability. I have owned Yamaha gear since I purchased my first keyboard back in the mid 80s (a DX9) and I honestly say that they have never let me down! Everyone talks about how great the acoustic and electric piano sounds are in the Motif, but I really love the big fat synth sounds that it can produce! Just an awesome keyboard.&quot;</em></p>
      <p> Tony Featherstone is best known as a member of the multi ARIA award winning Australian band The Badloves who’s collaboration with Jimmy Barnes's lead to a top 5 hit in Australia (The Weight) and a friendship that would see him as a regular member of Jimmy's touring band today. The Badloves spawned many hits including &quot;Green Limousine&quot; and &quot;Memphis&quot;.</p>
      <p>In addition to The Badloves and Jimmy Barnes, Tony has worked with Daryl Braithwaite, Pseudo Echo, Kylie Minogue, Adam Harvey and UK artist Desiree.</p>

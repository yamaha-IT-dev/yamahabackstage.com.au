  <p>Ben Grayson has been a stalwart on the Melbourne scene for nearly 20 years. He is a true chameleon, switching between pop, rock, jazz, soul and funk with ease and becoming one of the in-demand new breed of Australian musicians. As a founding member of the Bamboos he lit up dance floors across Australia and Europe with his Hammond organ skills and a long tenure ship with electro pop icons Pseudo Echo has shown he is equally at home on a keytar.</p>
  <p>In 2005 under the moniker <em>'Bennson'</em>, Grayson released the critically acclaimed boogie/soul record <em>'Let The Love'</em> on seminal Swedish label Raw Fusion. A three year stint in Berlin saw Grayson touring with German mega pop star Sarah Conner and nu-jazz legends Jazzanova. Recently Grayson has been performing with international acts like Omar (UK), Bilal (US), and Martha Wainwright (US). Regular contributions to X-Factor and Australia's Got Talent, both producing and performing live, well and truly establish Grayson as a heavyweight on the Australian musical landscape.</p>

She followed on to a degree in music improvisation at the prestigious Victorian College of the Arts, where she received tuition from Paul Grabowsky, Andrea Keller and Tony Gould.</p>
  <p>Nat is best known for her work in her jazz piano ensemble, Nat Bartsch Trio. This group showcases Nat’s original compositions, which have a distinctive style, drawing on the European jazz, indie rock and pop artists, and classical music.</p>

This recording was originally commissioned for ABC Classic FM’s Jazztrack Program. Nat played on a Yamaha C7 grand piano for both of these releases.</p>
  <p>She has also been the recipient of a number of awards. In 2006 her trio won the Athenaeum Award for <em>‘Best Improvisation Ensemble’</em>. In 2007 Nat was awarded the ‘Lionel Gell Travelling Scholarship’, funding study in Europe.

  <p>Nat has had a close relationship with Yamaha pianos since the very beginning of her music career.

  <h1>Sophie Koh</h1>
  <p><em>“A Yamaha grand piano just invites you to play. It somehow inspires you to write and play, even on a day you don't feel like doing so. What a treasure.”</em></p>
  <p>Sophie Koh was first <em>‘Unearthed’</em> by Triple J in Darwin, Australia. She is an award winning musician and songwriter. Sophie has been rewarded with TV appearances (Neighbours, Spicks &amp; Specks, RockWiz), awards (Best Female Artist - The Age), and supporting tours (The Eels, The Go-Betweens) across Australia. Sophie has a love for quirky pop songs but her musical beginnings were in classical piano.</p>
  <p>Sophie has independently released three studio albums. Her latest, Oh My Garden, was produced in L.A. with Brad Wood (Liz Phair, Veruca Salt) and includes collaborations with Aus indie-pop king Ben Lee. Her previous album All Shook Up was produced by Greg J.Walker (Machine Translations).</p>
  <p>Sophie was born in New Zealand, to Malaysian-Chinese parents and spent her childhood in Singapore and NZ. She is based in Melbourne. Sophie is a multi-instrumentalist and is at the helm of her own independent label Crying Ninja Records. In 2013, Sophie and her band embarked on a 14-date tour of China and her shows, performed in English and Mandarin, received rave reviews.</p>
